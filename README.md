**The Dataviz Card Game projects intends to create physical game cards as a support for knowledge transfer on the topic of data visualization.**

The Dataviz Card Game has been prototyped by Cédric Lombion in 2014, and was inspired by [The Dataviz Catalogue](http://www.datavizcatalogue.com/). It has since become a project under the banner of [Ecole des données](http://ecoledesdonnees.org/) (School of Data France) ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/ecoledesdonnees) and [contact](mailto:ecoledesdonnees@okfn.org)). The work on the project has been partially financed by [School of Data](http://schoolofdata.org/)'s innovation fund ([Twitter]() and [contact](http://schoolofdata.org/contact/)).

### Sweet! I want to know more!

A multidisciplinary team is actively working on creating a final version of the game, along with a cool website to host it. Our progress is documented in French and English on Github via the [wiki](https://github.com/ecoledesdonnees/dataviz-card-game/wiki/) and the blog (live soon!)

### Look, just tell me quickly how to contribute

The project requires skills and knowledge in:
* Graphic design
* Data Visualisation theory
* Programming (Javascript)
* Translation

We're also on the lookout for people who could help us get the final game in as many hands as possible.

If you wish to contribute, just contact us on the [public chatroom](https://gitter.im/ecoledesdonnees/dataviz-card-game) or [via mail](mailto:ecoledesdonnees@okfn.org), we're nice people!
